        "#### Introduction to ESG Investing and Stock Price Prediction\n",
        "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing has gained significant traction in recent years as investors seek to align their financial goals with their values. ESG investing involves considering a company's environmental impact, social responsibilities, and governance practices alongside traditional financial metrics. The underlying hypothesis is that companies with high ESG ratings not only contribute positively to society but also exhibit more stable and potentially superior financial performance. Our project aims to leverage machine learning models to predict stock prices by incorporating ESG scores with traditional financial indicators. This dual-focus approach aims to provide insights into whether ESG factors enhance the predictive power of financial models, thereby supporting socially responsible investment decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Prior Work on ESG and Financial Performance\n",
        "Previous studies have explored the relationship between ESG factors and financial performance, providing a foundation for our research. A notable study by Friede, Busch, and Bassen (2015) conducted a meta-analysis of over 2,000 empirical studies and found that the majority of these studies reported a positive relationship between ESG factors and corporate financial performance. This comprehensive review suggests that ESG criteria can be financially beneficial and supports the hypothesis that ESG-compliant companies may exhibit favorable stock performance.<a name=\"#fn1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#note-1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Further, a study by Khan, Serafeim, and Yoon (2016) published in the Journal of Accounting and Economics examined how material ESG issues—those that are likely to affect a company’s financial condition—are linked to stock price performance. They found that firms with good performance on material sustainability issues outperform those with poor performance, suggesting that ESG factors, when material, can provide valuable insights for investors.<a name=\"#fn2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#note-2)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of machine learning, there have been several attempts to predict stock prices using various algorithms. For instance, the use of LSTM neural networks for stock price prediction has been well-documented. A study by Fischer and Krauss (2018) utilized LSTM networks to predict S&P 500 stock prices and found that LSTM models significantly outperformed traditional models in capturing the temporal dependencies in financial data.<a name=\"#fn3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#note-3) This study highlights the potential of advanced machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In-Depth Study Analysis\n",
        "An in-depth analysis of the intersection of ESG investing and stock price prediction reveals a growing body of work focused on integrating ESG factors into financial models. One such study by Henisz, Koller, and Nuttall (2019) in the McKinsey Quarterly emphasized the increasing importance of ESG factors in driving long-term financial performance. Their research suggested that ESG issues are often linked to critical factors such as regulatory compliance, operational efficiencies, and brand reputation, which can significantly impact stock prices.<a name=\"#fn4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#note-4)\n",
        "\n",
        "Another significant study by Bolton and Kacperczyk (2020) investigated the relationship between carbon emissions and stock returns. They found that firms with higher carbon emissions tend to have lower stock returns, indicating that environmental factors can have a substantial impact on financial performance. This study aligns with the broader hypothesis that ESG factors, particularly environmental issues, play a critical role in influencing investor behavior and stock price trends.<a name=\"#fn5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#note-5)\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, a paper by Albuquerque, Koskinen, and Zhang (2019) published in the Journal of Financial Economics examined how corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities influence firm risk and stock returns. They discovered that firms engaging in CSR activities generally experience lower risk and higher returns, supporting the integration of social factors into investment models.<a name=\"#fn6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#note-6)\n",
