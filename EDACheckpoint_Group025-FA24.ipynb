    "#### Introduction to ESG Investing and Stock Price Prediction\n",
    "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing has gained significant traction in recent years as investors seek to align their financial goals with their values. ESG investing involves considering a company's environmental impact, social responsibilities, and governance practices alongside traditional financial metrics. The underlying hypothesis is that companies with high ESG ratings not only contribute positively to society but also exhibit more stable and potentially superior financial performance. Our project aims to leverage Machine Learning to predict stock prices by incorporating ESG scores with traditional financial indicators. This dual-focus approach aims to provide insights into whether ESG factors enhance the predictive power of financial models, thereby supporting socially responsible investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prior Work on ESG and Financial Performance\n",
    "Previous studies have explored the relationship between ESG factors and financial performance, providing a foundation for our research. A notable study by Friede, Busch, and Bassen (2015) conducted a meta-analysis of over 2,000 empirical studies and found that the majority of these studies reported a positive relationship between ESG factors and corporate financial performance. This comprehensive review suggests that ESG criteria can be financially beneficial and supports the hypothesis that ESG-compliant companies may exhibit favorable stock performance.<a name=\"#fn1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, a study by Khan, Serafeim, and Yoon (2016) published in the Journal of Accounting and Economics examined how material ESG issues—those that are likely to affect a company’s financial condition—are linked to stock price performance. They found that firms with good performance on material sustainability issues outperform those with poor performance, suggesting that ESG factors, when material, can provide valuable insights for investors.<a name=\"#fn2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of Machine Learning, there have been several attempts to predict stock prices using various algorithms. For instance, the use of LSTM neural networks for stock price prediction has been well-documented. A study by Fischer and Krauss (2018) utilized LSTM networks to predict S&P 500 stock prices and found that LSTM models significantly outperformed traditional models in capturing the temporal dependencies in financial data.<a name=\"#fn3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#note-3) This study highlights the use of leveraging neural networks to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In-Depth Study Analysis\n",
    "An in-depth analysis of the intersection of ESG investing and stock price prediction reveals a growing body of work focused on integrating ESG factors into financial models. One such study by Henisz, Koller, and Nuttall (2019) in the McKinsey Quarterly emphasized the increasing importance of ESG factors in driving long-term financial performance. Their research suggested that ESG issues are often linked to critical factors such as regulatory compliance, operational efficiencies, and brand reputation, which can significantly impact stock prices.<a name=\"#fn4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#note-4) This is promising for those looking to make sustainable investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another significant study by Bolton and Kacperczyk (2020) investigated the relationship between carbon emissions and stock returns. They found that firms with higher carbon emissions tend to have lower stock returns, indicating that environmental factors can have a substantial impact on financial performance. This study aligns with the broader hypothesis that ESG factors, particularly environmental issues, play a critical role in influencing investor behavior and stock price trends.<a name=\"#fn5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#note-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a paper by Albuquerque, Koskinen, and Zhang (2019) published in the Journal of Financial Economics examined how corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities influence firm risk and stock returns. They discovered that firms engaging in CSR activities generally experience lower risk and higher returns, supporting the integration of social factors into investment models.<a name=\"#fn6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#note-6)\n",

    "For meaningful analysis, data from publicly traded companies across various sectors spanning multiple years will be considered to capture long-term trends. This will allow for insights into broader trends beyond isolated industry cases. The variables that we will be taking into consideration for our financial indicators include daily closing stock prices for a predetermined amount of time, P/E ratios, dividend yield, and market capitalization. Additionally, ESG score variables will be used along with risk ratings for the same to determine the sustainability levels associated with each stock.\n",

    "Organizing this data by company and date in a structured database would allow for easy querying and updating for ongoing analysis. Financial data which includes historical stock prices and ratios can be sourced from Yahoo Finance. It offers consistent financial metrics through public APIs, as well as alternative providers like Alpha Vantage and Quandl. ESG scores, on the other hand, often require more specialized sources; agencies like MSCI and Refinitiv provide detailed ESG datasets, though access may be restricted by company size, geography, and disclosure practices. Public filings and government databases, such as the EPA and SEC in the U.S., can also supplement ESG data.\n",

    "This dataset provides Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings for publicly traded companies, with important variables including **environment_score**, **social_score**, **governance_score**, and **total_score**. Each of these scores represents an assessment of the company's practices in various ESG categories. For instance, **environment_score** reflects how well the company manages its environmental impact, while **governance_score** assesses the quality of its corporate governance practices. These scores are numerical, which allows us to use them as metrics for quantifying a company’s sustainability and ethical performance. In terms of wrangling, we simplified the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns and ensuring that all ticker symbols were converted to uppercase to facilitate merging with other datasets."

    "Volatility features measure the variability of stock prices, providing insights into the risk associated with the stock. Higher volatility indicates higher risk, which is critical for risk management strategies.

    "The Gradient Boosting model has slightly higher MAE compared to Random Forest but a lower MSE. The R² score of 0.978992 indicates that this model explains approximately 97.90% of the variance in the target variable, making it slightly better than Random Forest in terms of variance explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression:\n",
    "Linear Regression has the lowest MAE and MSE among all models, indicating that it performs extremely well on this dataset. The R² score of 0.999256 suggests that the model explains 99.93% of the variance in the target variable, which is exceptionally high.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression and Ridge Regression: These models perform the best, with very low MAE and MSE and extremely high R² scores. This indicates that a simple linear relationship explains the data very well. Ridge Regression’s similar performance suggests that the data does not suffer significantly from multicollinearity.\n",
    "Gradient Boosting: While it performs well, it does not outperform the simpler Linear and Ridge Regression models. This might be due to the dataset being well-suited for linear models.\n",
    "Random Forest: This model also performs well but is outperformed by both Gradient Boosting and the linear models."

    "Our project aim is to predict stock performance using ESG and financial data, but we recognize ethical considerations surrounding biases, privacy, and the equitable representation of companies. One key ethical concern is the assumption that high ESG scores universally translate to better financial performance. This can potentially inherently favor larger companies with resources to meet high ESG standards, leaving smaller firms with the disadvantage of lacking the means to fully report or attain these scores. Therefore, we will diversify our dataset by including companies of varying sizes and across different industries to reduce this potential bias and transparently communicate this limitation in our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using publicly available data from reputable sources such as Yahoo Finance and MSCI, while respecting the terms of use and reporting biases will be considered, since companies are likely to be selective in the ESG data that they choose to report. This is particularly relevant for companies with robust resources, which may skew the dataset toward well-established firms.. Our analysis will include balancing techniques where possible and clear communication around potential skewed findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias Detection and Mitigation:\n",
    "- Before Analysis: We will assess data diversity by evaluating the range of company sizes, industries, and geographical locations to ensure our dataset reflects a balanced representation.\n",
    "- During Analysis: We will conduct feature analysis to evaluate the weights assigned to financial versus ESG factors, ensuring both are equitably represented.\n",
    "- Post-Analysis: When reporting results, we will explicitly address any biases or limitations observed, including transparency on whether ESG factors have influenced predictions in unintended ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recognize that ESG scores are not absolute indicators of financial success, we will communicate that our model’s predictions are limited by the current availability and quality of ESG data. We aim to provide responsible insights by acknowledging the potential limitations of ESG scores for financial forecasting, and we will structure our analysis and reporting to transparently communicate any ethical concerns."
